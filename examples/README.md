# Model balancing example runs

This directory contains preprocessed input data as well as results for the foru models from the folder `resources/models`.

Input files for model balancing in python are stored in the subdirectory `examples/json`. An example file contains all information about model structure, distributions, and measurement data that define a model balancing problem. The files are generated by matlab and contain the input data for model balancing in python.

Model balancing results (computed by Matlab) are stored in `examples/results/[MODEL_NAME]`.

Graphics (scatter plots for the same models) can be found in `examples/graphics`.
