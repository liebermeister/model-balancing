# Model balancing example runs

This directory contains input data and results for the models from `../resources/models`.

* Input files for model balancing in python can be found in the subdirectory `examples/json`. The files (in json format) contain all information about model structure, distributions, and measurement data that define a model balancing problem. They are generated by matlab and define a model balancing problem to be solved in python.

* Model balancing results (computed by Matlab) are stored in `examples/results/[MODEL_NAME]`.

* Scatter plots showing these results  can be found in `examples/graphics`.
