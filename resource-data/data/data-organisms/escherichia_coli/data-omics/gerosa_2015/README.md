* Flux and metabolite values are from the Supplementary Data S2 in [Gerosa et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2015.09.008).
* The **metabolite** tab in the file `flux.ods` is derived from the `metabolite concentrations` tab.
* The **flux** tab in the file `flux.ods` is derived from `Metabolic fluxes` tab.
* Protein concentration data is from values are from the Supplementary Table S4 in [Schmidt et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3418).
* The **protein** tab in the file `flux.ods` was calculated by mapping gene names to BiGG reaction IDs using the iML1515 model, and summing up the data of all the genes associated with each reaction (ignoring the specific gene rules).
